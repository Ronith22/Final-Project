Description: Play as Carlo the Gorilla scaling a skyscraper in New York as 
barrels are thrown down at you.

About: Play as Carlo the Gorilla switching directions to avoid falling barrels from the top of 
the skyscraper. These barrels will fall from random locations (x) and will fall at differing speeds.
Each barrel dodged will increase your score by one, colliding with a barrel will end the game.
